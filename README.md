# EarnKarma Project: GLDKRM Token Offering

## Introduction

This repository serves as the foundation for the initial phase of the EarnKarma protocol's development. 


## GLDKRM: The Equity Token

GLDKRM is the designated equity token for EarnKarma and is pivotal in ensuring the project's self-sustainability. By acquiring GLDKRM tokens, you are not only contributing to the development of the protocol but also becoming a part of the DAO collecting future dividends from staking your tokens.

## Funding & Token Allocation

### Funding Goal

Our immediate aim is to secure a funding of $2.1 million, which will facilitate the next three years of EarnKarma's development, thereby ensuring it remains at the forefront of blockchain innovation.

### Token Sale

To achieve this funding goal, we plan to sell 65% of the GLDKRM token supply. This will be conducted through a public sale, details of which will be announced soon.

### Remaining Allocation

- **Private Sales**: A certain portion will be allocated for private sales, aimed at investors who are deeply aligned with our mission.
  
- **Incentives for Collaborators**: As we appreciate the hard work and dedication of our collaborators, a percentage of the GLDKRM token supply will be set aside as incentives.
  
- **Founders' Share**: Last but not least, a fair percentage will be allocated for the founders who initiated this project and will steer it towards success.
